# etch-a-sketch

A JavaScript-based digital etch-a-sketch built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) web development curriculum.

It can be viewed live at https://milkywaysquirreldeer.github.io/etch-a-sketch using a desktop browser.*

*Please note that it is not tested against mobile browsers, as the project focus is on JavaScript DOM Manipulation and Flexbox fundamentals (responsive design comes later in the curriculum).

The etch-a-sketch project prompt can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).
